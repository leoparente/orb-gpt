            And that an agent with 1 orb tag(s) already exists and is online
        When 1 Agent Group(s) is created with all tags contained in the agent
        Then 1 agent must be matching on response field matching_agents of the last group created
            And the container logs should contain the message "completed RPC subscription to group" within 30 seconds
            And this agent's heartbeat shows that 1 groups are matching the agent
