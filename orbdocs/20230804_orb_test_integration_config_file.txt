Feature: Integration tests using agent provided via config file


@private @auto_provision
Scenario: General smoke test to validate private agent image - using configuration files
    Given the Orb user has a registered account
        And the Orb user logs in
        And that a sink with default configuration type already exists
    When an agent(input_type:pcap, settings: {"iface":"default"}) is self-provisioned via a configuration file on port available with 3 agent tags and has status online. [Overwrite default: False. Paste only file: True]
        And pktvisor state is running
        And 1 Agent Group(s) is created with all tags contained in the agent
        And 3 simple policies same input_type as created via config file are applied to the group
    Then 3 dataset(s) have validity valid and 0 have validity invalid in 30 seconds
        And the container logs should contain the message "completed RPC subscription to group" within 30 seconds
        And this agent's heartbeat shows that 1 groups are matching the agent
        And this agent's heartbeat shows that 3 policies are applied and all has status running
        And the container logs that were output after all policies have been applied contain the message "scraped metrics for policy" referred to each applied policy within 180 seconds
        And referred sink must have active state on response within 120 seconds
        And the container logs contain the message "policy applied successfully" referred to each policy within 30 seconds
