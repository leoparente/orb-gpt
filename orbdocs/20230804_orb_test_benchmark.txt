  @benchmark @bench_agent
  Scenario Outline: Benchmark memory usage multiple policies
    Given the Orb user has a registered account
    And agent will be monitored in cpu and memory usage with <amount> policies applied
    And the Orb user logs in
    And that an agent with 1 orb tag(s) already exists and is online
    And pktvisor state is running
    And referred agent is subscribed to 1 group
    And this agent's heartbeat shows that 1 groups are matching the agent
    And that a sink with default configuration type already exists
    When <amount> mixed policies are applied to the group
    Then this agent's heartbeat shows that <amount> policies are applied and all has status running
    And the container logs contain the message "policy applied successfully" referred to each policy within <waiting_time> seconds
    And <amount> dataset(s) have validity valid and 0 have validity invalid in <waiting_time> seconds
    And monitor the activity of memory usage during <monitor_time> minutes
    Examples:
      | amount | waiting_time | monitor_time |
      | 20     | 30           |  3           |
      | 50     | 30           |  3           |
      | 100    | 60           |  5           |
      | 200    | 60           |  5           |
      | 500    | 60           |  5           |
